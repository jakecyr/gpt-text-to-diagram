**This isn't fully functional and was a quick test to see if this was possible.**

## Usage

1. Install all packages with `npm install`.
2. Copy the .env.example file to a new file .env and fill in the `OPENAI_KEY` value with your OpenAI API key.
3. Optionally update the prompt in the main.js script.
4. Run the script with `npm start` to generate an design diagram .svg file from your prompt.
